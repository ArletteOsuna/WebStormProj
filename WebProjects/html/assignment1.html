    <h1> Welcome to my website, my name is Arlette Osuna.</h1>
    <p>The purpose of this website is for you to learn about my <b>interests/likes.</b> I will be discussing some of my
        hobbies as well such as going to the gym and doing nails. As for interests I will discuss how I enjoy
        the outdoors and listening to music.</p>

        <h2> One of my interests/hobbies is going to the gym.</h2>
            <p>I enjoy lifting weights and exercising. My favorite part from lifting is being
           able to lift more than one would think, I love being strong. I took on this hobby in May 2021 and have
            continued to be consistent.</p>

         <h2> Another one of my interests/hobbies is doing nails.</h2>
            <p>I am a nail technician and enjoy being able to express my creative side
            through it. I took on this hobby during the summer and still enjoy it
            to this day. When doing nail extensions, I specifically do <i>Gel X nails</i>.</p>

        <h2> I also enjoy the outdoors.</h2>
          <p>I love hanging out by the beach and hearing the waves. My favorite place to be at is
            the beach. I love how relaxing it feels, with the sun hitting you and being able to
            "let go."</p>

         <h2> Continuing off the outdoors, I also enjoy going on hikes and being in nature.</h2>
          <p>To me nature is such a beautiful thing, I love seeing the green grass and the
            trees full of leaves. I love seeing the mountains and seeing waterfalls, it is a
            very peaceful view.</p>

        <h2> I really enjoy listening to music.</h2>
           <p>I am open to different music genres, but I am most interested in listening to
            reggaeton. I also enjoy listening to R&B because of how soothing it can be.</p>
