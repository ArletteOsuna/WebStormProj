         <h2> What is Gel X?</h2>
            <p>Gel-X is a "soft extension," lengthening your nails while still allowing the flexible feeling. They
                appear as clear press-on extensions coming in a variety of nail shapes. It is made of gel polish and
                is applied directly on the natural nail, covering the entire nail from cuticle to free edge. When
                applied they can last from 3-4 weeks minimum while maximum can vary from 4-9 weeks depending on how
                they are taken care of. Below is a video of how to apply the Gel X extensions. </p>
